Our group's project idea is to create an interface/game that allows players to lay tracks (railway tracks, rollercoaster tracks, highway tracks, etc) around a room and simulate both building and navigating it. There are many extensions we could implement, including some ideas we have around racing/multiplayer, extra track mechanisms (portals, switching, powered rail), graphical details, and more. You can look at our [Project Proposal Presentation], or read our [Project Proposal Document] for more detail.


We are currently entering the prototyping phase, and the first component of the project we'll be focusing on is implementing the ability to build tracks.


## Potential Track Building Interactions

Out of the feedback, we are considering and exploring a variety of different building techniques, in order to determine the most enjoyable and useful options.

The first option allows users to select the ‘next’ piece from a library of track parts. This piece then snaps onto the existing track, and can allow the user to make various piece-specific modifications (such as elevation gain, curvature, and torque). In this fashion, the user can iteratively create the track. It limits the main interactions into two parts: selection of the desired piece, and then adjustment of the piece. The former can be solved relatively easily with a piece library, potentially pinned to the environment, attached to the user, or in a summonable UI. The latter requires more exploration, but can potentially be managed by selecting distinct control points for each interaction, and adjusting them with the finger ‘scroll’ behavior. This interaction easily allows additional functionality, by simply creating new track types for the library. As long as the pieces can appropriately mesh at endpoints, each piece can handle its individual presentation.

The second option revolves around iteratively placing control points, in order to build a track curve. Beginning in a specified position, the interaction allows the user to specify a next ‘control point,’ which is then used in combination with the previous in order to interpolate a curve. There could be some functionality for adjusting the curve, given the 3D nature, but the primary interaction would be to place points. This could happen in continuous 3D space, or require some snap-to grid functionality. This behavior follows the paradigm of Minecraft minecart tracks, where the user simply specifies track locations, which determine a track ‘path.’ Once the path is determined, the track is then drawn on top, curving as appropriate. With more complex track functionality, this second part will require some user input, in order to determine what style of piece should get rendered for ‘segments.’ It also requires pieces to be able to render on arbitrary curves.

A third option is to present the user with an initial loop, and then allow them to manipulate the loop, pulling, and stretching it into the final shape. This can be considered an extension of the second option, above, as it simply specifies an initial set of control points in a circuit, and then allows manipulation and addition of these. Interaction would make sense with hand controls, where you could pull the loop taffy-style. However, with the limited gesture functionality of the current HoloLens, it will potentially require less intuitive controls. Additionally, specifying complex behavior (like corkscrews) could be challenging and require a lot of time investment, compared to having presets. This might be addressable by having a library of ‘transforms’ for segments of the track. It also runs into the same issue of requiring a secondary set of user inputs to determine segments types, or having some automatic assignment.

A fourth option is to allow the user to draw the track using a finger or controller. The tracking could be aided by a reference marker to assist recognition. Following the user’s motion, once activated, the system can mark the 3D motion, saving control points to generate a smooth matching curve. With this option, though, users are encouraged to conceptualize the system as a whole, rather than building their creation part by part. This could provide a barrier to creativity if the editing flow is not sufficiently usable. Additionally, this option is similar to options two and three, suffering from some of the same complications with track type assignment. However, this does provide a powerful method for refinement on a segment-level scale. When making edits after initial path creation, ach of these three options could allow users to redraw a segment, in order to refine the track path.

Each of these options has its advantages, and merits further exploration. Over the next few weeks, we will be prototyping some of these basic interactions, and investigating the implementation complexity. Ultimately, though, we will need to choose one that fits within the constraints of the current technology, and that best fits with our building paradigm, and how we want users to express their ideas.
