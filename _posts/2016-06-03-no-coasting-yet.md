Overall, we felt that our demo plan worked fairly well. It was fun, but did feel very chaotic at times, and we learned plenty from the experience, so we have a few changes we're considering for next week:

## Demo Changes

1. We want to have a second table. We used an atrium table to help out, but having a little more space to set things down will allow us to differentiate charged and charging hololens devices more easily, and also block out team use space more clearly
1. It would be nice to switch out one hololens that has a screw socket that seems to be stripped, as it keeps popping out, which means we can't use it reliably in a demo setting.
1. We'd like to mark the entrance more clearly, so we can have a well-defined queue of people. This may just be tape, or some careful placement of tables, but this will help streamline people flowing in for the demo.
1. We are considering timing people (for the non-VIP demo), so that we can move people through reliably, as a few just kept trying to play more and more (which is awesome in many ways!)
1. It would be awesome to have a way to better set IPD, or a way to avoid doing so (addressed somewhat by the neat tool we just got emailed about, that streamlines setting it for multiple devices, so thank you!)
1. We're going to change our demo flow to teaching people how to tap before putting on the device. Alternately, there was talk of having them learn this at the IPD station, which would be helpful. Many people struggled to learn the tap once they had the device on, because they kept trying to play with the app, and didn't want to pay attention to our demo of tapping, so teaching beforehand would help prepare them to use it productively.
1. Teaching people how to tap and hold for adjustments beforehand may be useful, too.
1. We noted down some changes to the application, based on implicit and explicit feedback, that we think would help people more intuitively use it. This includes things like potentially placing the first track at a set offset in front of the user, rather than defining the position at app start, adding a marker to indicate the end of the track (matching with the menu icons, probably).
1. We're considering focusing on the single player experience, and maybe only having two devices set up with sharing, only for when two people come together, where we can have one person assist both, and guide them through sharing.
1. The demo track we have right now was pretty tame, so we want to create an awesome one with lots of spirals and loops. We are thinking of capping the demo off with having them load that.
1. We ran almost all of the hololens simultaneously, but may limit that to only using 4-6 of them, in order to ensure we have some charging.
1. We will be shooting a more polished video
1. We may try to get/make t-shirts, to differentiate team members, so people can easily tell who to talk to. The line mentioned above will help somewhat with confusion, too.
