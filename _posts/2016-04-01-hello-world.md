Welcome to our development blog, where we will be chronicling our project for [CSE 599v1], “Virtual and Augmented Reality.” The [four of us] are students in the 5th Year Masters Program for Computer Science and Engineering, at the University of Washington. For the class, we will be developing a project using Microsoft HoloLens. As part of this, we will be posting weekly progress updates, along with development documents and artifacts. We hope you enjoy following along as we develop for and explore this new medium!
