## What we accomplished 

This week, we co-won the video contest, which was very exciting.  For this week’s work, each teammate worked on a different part of a prototype demo.  Sonja explored MegaShapes and built out a prototype with adding 3 types of tracks.  She also helped Nick hook up the menu to the controls for adding tracks.  Nick worked on the menu UI, made it move with the user’s gaze, and added interaction with the menu.  He also worked with Sonja to hook up the menu to the controls for adding tracks.  Jenny explored functionality for saving and loading tracks.  Riley worked on hooking up animation of an object along a MegaShape and explored how to make object follow orientation of the shape to work with twisting.


## Plan for Next Week
For next week, we want to allow more interactions with the menu, and more types of track.  We also are working on detecting and fixing basic track collisions when the track occludes itself.  We are also working on spatial mapping and having the tracks occluded by the environment.  For the next week we are also looking into different interaction with the menu: voice commands, having the menu not only follow you around but do so in an intelligent way, spatial sound feedback for adding pieces of track.  A stretch goal for next week is the ability to interact with sections of track already laid, like undoing a section or deforming the bezier curve.  For next week on the animation side, we would like to have multiple blocks able to animate along the track like a long train would.  We also want to be able to support a track that has orientation deformation.  Users won’t be able to modify this yet in the build mode, but we want to support this and work on the animation already.   On the saving and loading side of things, in the next week we want to save something across app sessions, save a segment of the track and load a track from the previous session.  Hopefully this will allow us to also explore more complicated track scenarios since we won’t have to start over with building every time.


## Notes

We bought MegaShapes and switched underlying representation to this new asset. Since our previous asset, MeshDeformer, had poor performance that caused the app to freeze with each interaction, we needed to make sure this new asset was performant. Since the asset was not cheap, we did a lot of background research before making the purchase, including reading all the reviews for this asset on the Unity Asset Store, reading the documentation on the developer’s website, and reading the forums. Once the purchase was made, we spent a day learning how the asset worked, as it was much more heavyweight than MeshDeformer. Once we felt reasonably comfortable with MegaShapes, we did performance testing on the new asset to make sure it could render the scenes we wanted at 60fps, the maximum the HoloLens supports. At first when we built a scene and deployed it to the HoloLens, the scene would flicker and update was slow when moving the POV (moving your head). Using an fps tracker, we found that we were only getting 7 fps. After some investigation, we discovered that the fps was also low when running on a PC (around 20fps), and this was due to the realtime checkbox in the asset that was selected. This was rebuilding the geometry on each frame, making it slow. Unchecking this got us up to the 60fps we desired. 

Since the render layer for this asset does not stretch the geometry to fit into one bezier curve like the previous asset, we moved to a model we had brainstormed previously of having two modes - build mode and render/play mode. This allows us to create our own mesh segments during the building process, which means we have greater control over selecting and highlighting only one piece of the track and allowing the user to modify the track locally. For now, we have a simple profile curve that we extrude along the path the user is building, with one mesh per bezier curve. Since we also have a render mode that clones intricate meshes along the path, we will likely not invest too much effort into making the build mode look realistic, but rather opt for a clean and simple interface.  For the play mode, we will render different types of track and different textures to make the track look and feel realistic.  In the play mode, the user will also be able to play an animation and watch an object travel along the track.  This week, we explored animating an object along the track, starting at the beginning of the track and following the entire spline, including if the spline raises and lowers in elevation. 

For the UI, we developed the menu this week to allow us to add different types of tracks with gaze and selection.  We have a toggle button at the top of the menu to switch between the play and the build modes, we also have buttons for each type of basic track we’d like to support.  We added the ability to select a type of track with gaze and then gesture to add that track to the end of the spline that is built so far.  So far, we have three types of tracks that work, a straight piece of track, a left curve, and a right curve.  The menu UI also follows the user’s gaze, so as they step around and explore their environment, they will always have easy access to the menu.
