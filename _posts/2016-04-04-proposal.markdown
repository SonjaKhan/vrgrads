Our group's project idea is to create an interface/game that allows players to lay tracks (railway tracks, rollercoaster tracks, highway tracks, etc) around a room and simulate both bulding and navigating it. There are many extensions we could implement, including some ideas we have around racing/multiplayer, extra track mechanisms (portals, switching, powered rail), graphical details, and more.
